# Betbot
A bot in progress that will lose your money for free (actually made profit during runtime, but n < 100)


Uses python praw to search for previously vetted handicappers that post on reddit/r/sportsbook.
Parses comments into bets (specifically in MLB), what odds the handicapper took the bet at, and however many units they staked.

Relied on two handicappers who had a very good trackrecord, which resulted in a net profit over 100+ bets, but then they stopped posting :(

(may not work on most recent python3 versions)
